Kawkah is a Node command line parser written in Typescript. It's purpose is to simplify parsing CLI arguments for complex CLI applications. One of the key benefits of Kawkah is the use of customizable middleware. If you wish to add a feature into the pipeline simply add custom middleware. We'll get to that in a moment.

### NOTE

Kawkah is not in production as of yet. Although fairly stable many more tests need to be written more debugging blah blah blah you get the idea.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install kawkah
```

## Usage

Here are the basics. After instantiating define your args, flags and other settings then call <code>.listen()</code> to have Kawkah listen for process.argv arguments.

```ts
import { Kawkah } from 'kawkah';

// OR

const Kawkah = require('kawkah').Kawkah;
const kk = new Kawkah({ /* options */ });

kk
  .arg('order', {
    coerce: v => v.toUpperCase()
  })
  .flag('toppings', {
    type: 'array',
    validate: /(cheese|mushroom|ham)/
  })
  .flag('deep-dish')
  .listen('order --toppings cheese --toppings ham --deep-dish');

// RESULT

const result = {
  {
    _: [ 'ORDER' ],
    __: [],
    toppings: [ 'cheese', 'ham' ],
    deepDish: true,
    '$0': 'app',
    '$command': null
  }
}
```
